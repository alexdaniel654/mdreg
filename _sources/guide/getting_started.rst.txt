Getting started

Model-driven registration is a method to remove motion from a series of 2D or 3D images. It applies specifically to situations where a model exists that can describe the changes in signal intensity through the series. 

The default engine for coregistration in ``mdreg`` is the package ``itk-elastix``, but coregistration models from other packages are integrated as well (``scikit-image``, ``dipy``). 

For modelling, a number of generic models are built-in, but ``mdreg`` includes an interface for integrating custom-built models, or models from any other package. 

This guide illustrates these different types of usage with an example use case, that of fitting the longitudinal MRI relaxation time T1 in the abdomen from a Look-Locker MRI sequence. 

Import packages and data
========================

Let's start by importing the packages needed in this tutorial. 

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import mdreg

``mdreg`` includes a number of test data sets for demonstration purposes. Let's fetch the MOLLI example and use ``mdreg``'s built-in plotting tools to visualise the motion:

.. code-block:: python

    # fetch the data
    data = mdreg.fetch('MOLLI')

    # We will consider the slice z=0 of the data array:
    array = data['array'][:,:,0,:]

    # Use the built-in animation function of mdreg to visualise the motion:
    mdreg.animation(array, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/fetch_molli.gif
  :width: 600


Using built-in models
=====================

The breathing motion is clearly visible in this slice. Let's use ``mdreg`` to remove it. As a starting point, we try ``mdreg`` with default settings.

.. code-block:: python

    # Perform model-driven coregistration with default settings
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True) 

.. image:: ../_static/animations/mdreg_default.gif
  :width: 600


The default model is a constant, so the model fit (left) does not show any changes. The coregistered image (right) clearly shows the deformations, but they do not have the desired effect. This is not unexpected, because a constant model does not provide a good approximation to the changes in image contrast.
  
In this case we are lucky -- the appropriate model for a MOLLI sequence is `abs_exp_recovery_2p` and is included in ``mdreg``'s model library. We just need to tell ``mdreg`` which fitting function to use (``'func'``), and provide the keyword arguments required by the model. For this model these are the inversion times TI in units of sec. We define the signal model up front so it can be used again later in this script:

.. code-block:: python

    molli = {

        # The function to fit the data
        'func': mdreg.abs_exp_recovery_2p,

        # The keyword arguments required by the function
        'TI': np.array(data['TI'])/1000,
    }

Now we can run ``mdreg`` with this model and check the result again:

.. code-block:: python

    # Perform model-driven coregistration
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array, fit_image=molli)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/molli_builtin.gif
  :width: 600


This now shows essentially the desired result. The model fit (left) and the deformed image (right) are now both very similar in image contrast to the original data (middle), but with motion removed. 


Using custom-built models
=========================

In some cases the required model may not be available in the ``mdreg`` library, in which case it needs to be custom built. 

Wrapping existing models
------------------------

We illustrate this idea using the T1-MOLLI model from the ``ukat`` library. All that is needed in order to use it inside ``mdreg`` is to wrap it into a function that takes the image array as argument, and returns the fit to the model and the fitted model parameters. 

.. code-block:: python

    from ukat.mapping.t1 import T1

    def ukat_t1_model(array, TI=None):
        map = T1(array, TI, np.eye(4), parameters=2, multithread=False)
        return map.get_fit_signal(), (map.t1_map, map.m0_map)

We can now use this custom model in the same way as built-in models when we run ``mdreg``:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define the fit function and its arguments
    ukat_model = {
        'func': ukat_t1_model,
        'TI': np.array(data['TI']),
    }

    # Perform model-driven coregistration
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array, fit_image=ukat_model)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/molli_ukat.gif
  :width: 600

As expected, the result is the same as before using the built-in model `abs_exp_recovery_2p` **TODO: currently NOT the case - fix bug in ukat solution**

Pixel-by-pixel fitting
----------------------

In cases where the model is not available in any existing package, or the user is not prepared to import an existing package, the fit function must be written from scratch. In general, ``mdreg`` only requires that it has the same interface as the `ukat_t1_model` defined above: one argument (the image array), any number of keyword arguments, and two return values (the model fit and the fit parameters).

``mdreg`` offers a convenient shortcut for the common scenario where a 1D signal model is applied for each pixel independently (*pixel-by-pixel fitting*). All that is needed is to define the 1D model explicitly. 

.. code-block:: python

    def my_pixel_model(xdata, S0, T1):
        return np.abs(S0 * (1 - 2 * np.exp(-xdata/T1)))

Optionally, one may also provide a function that derives initial values from the data and any constant initial values provided by the user.

.. code-block:: python

    def my_pixel_model_init(xdata, ydata, p0):
        S0 = np.amax(np.abs(ydata))
        return [S0*p0[0], p0[1]]

With these definitions in hand, a pixel model fit can be defined as a dictionary specifying the model, its parameters (xdata), and any optional arguments.

.. code-block:: python

    my_pixel_fit = {

        # The custom-built single pixel model
        'model': my_pixel_model,

        # xdata for the single-pixel model
        'xdata': np.array(data['TI'])/1000,

        # Optional: custom-built initialization function
        'func_init': my_pixel_model_init,

        # Optional: initial values for the free parameters
        'p0': [1,1.3], 

        # Optional: bounds for the free model parameters
        'bounds': (0, np.inf),
 
        # Optional: any keyword arguments accepted by scipy's curve_fit
        'xtol': 1e-3,
    }   

And this can be provided directly to `mdreg.fit` via the keyword argument ``fit_pixel`` - instructing ``mdreg`` to perform pixel-based fitting using the parameters defined in ``my_pixel_fit``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Perform model-driven coregistration with a custom pixel model
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array, fit_pixel=my_pixel_fit)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/molli_my_fit.gif
  :width: 600

As expected, the result is the same as before using the built-in model `abs_exp_recovery_2p` and the ukat implementation `ukat_t1_model`. **TODO: currently NOT the case - fix bug in ukat solution**


Customizing the coregistration
==============================

In the above examples we have not provided any detail on the coregistration itself, which means that the default in ``mdreg`` has been applied. This is the standard b-spline coregistration of elastix, but modified to use a least-squares metric rather than mutual information. The detailed default parameter settings can be found in the function `mdreg.elastix.params`.

We can try to improve the result further by customizing the coregistration model rather than using the default. This can be done either by modifying the ``elastix`` parameters, or by using another coregistration package supported by ``mdreg`` (currently only ``skimage`` available).

Customizing elastix coregistration
----------------------------------

To illustrate customizing the ``elastix`` parameters, we perform ``mdreg`` with a more fine-grained deformation field. The default coregistration uses a grid spacing of 5cm, which is relatively coarse, so we will try a finer deformation of 5mm. In order to do that, we need to provide the actual pixel spacing of the data, and modify default elastix parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    deform5mm = {

        # Pixel spacing in the images
        'spacing': data['pixel_spacing'],

        # Default elastix parameters with custom grid spacing
        'params': mdreg.elastix.params(FinalGridSpacingInPhysicalUnits= "5.0"),
    }

We run ``mdreg`` again with the correct signal model, but now using the 5mm coregistration:

.. code-block:: python

    # Perform model-driven coregistration
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array, fit_image=molli, fit_coreg=deform5mm)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/molli_custom_coreg.gif
  :width: 600

The effect of the finer deformations is apparent, but it has not fundamentally improved the result. In fact, it has created smaller unphysical deformations that have blurred out some of the anatomical features. An example is the small cyst in the upper pole of the right kidney, which is clearly visible in the data but can no longer be seen in the model fit. The example illustrates that the grid spacing is a critical parameter and should be chosen to reflect the scale of the expected deformations. 

Any coregistration method available in elastix can be used in the same way by providing a custom set of elstix parameters.

Coregistration with ``skimage``
-------------------------------

While `itk-elastix` is the default package for coregistration, ``mdreg`` also has an option to use coregistration modules from the package `scikit-image`. 

For this illustration we run skimage coregistration with default parameters, except for the attachment which is increased to 30 (default=15) to allow for finer deformations.

.. code-block:: python

    attach30 = {

        # The package needs to be defined if it is not elastix
        'package': 'skimage',

        # Use default parameters except for the attachment
        'params': mdreg.skimage.params(attachment=30)
    }

Run ``mdreg`` again with the correct signal model, but now using the customized `skimage` coregistration:

.. code-block:: python

    # Perform model-driven coregistration
    coreg, defo, fit, pars = mdreg.fit(array, fit_image=molli, fit_coreg=attach30)

    # Visualise the results
    mdreg.plot_series(array, fit, coreg, vmin=0, vmax=1e4, show=True)

.. image:: ../_static/animations/molli_skimage.gif
  :width: 600

This result shows good coregistration results, in this case better preserving fine grain features such as kidney cysts in comparison to the default elastix implementation.
